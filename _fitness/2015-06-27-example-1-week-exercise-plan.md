Please note, this is not a personalised plan, this is an example of something similar to what I do on a weekly basis. Modify this plan to suit your needs, to suit your fitness levels and/or injuries, and to fit into your schedule. If you have set exercises written down to complete each week, you will be more likely to complete it all. If you have any questions, or would like some advice please send me an email and I will get back to you as soon as I can.
