title: About Healthy Desires
---
<p>Hi, my name is Raya and I live in Warrnambool, Victoria. A couple of years ago I graduated from Deakin University with a Bachelor of Commerce - but my passion is with nutrition. I also recently completed my certificate 4 in Massage Therapies, which makes me a qualified Relaxation Massage Therapist. I have always had a passion for fitness and health, but I guess I never really understood health to its true extent. I ate veggies with my dinner most days, and always ate fruit everyday, so I figured that I was "healthy." My daily diet also consisted of lollies, chips, donuts, chocolate, and fatty greasy food. I would be craving something sweet, so I would go for a run, and afterwards eat a slice, I figured that it would just cancel each other out- oh how I was wrong. I have done a lot of nutrition study myself at home, and I have also gone back to University to study nutrition, to further deepen my understanding. I am studying a Bachelor of Health Sciences, majoring in Nutrition, Physical Activity and Health, and Health Promotion.</p>
<p>I work at a shop in Warrnambool called Pronto Fine Food Merchants. I see myself as a "people person", and I love working there and meeting new people and sharing my knowledge about healthy food to our customers.</p>
<p>About 4 years ago my transition to better health started. I decided to start replacing foods that I ate too much of, and the first two "foods" were the typical unhealthy chocolate and also donuts. It was hard but I still ate many other bad foods to replace these favourite snacks.  I gave up soft drink and then I decided to eat healthy 5 days during the week, and on the weekend I could eat whatever I wanted. This worked out well and I started to feel great- until Saturday came along each week and I would eat heaps and heaps of bad food, and would feel yukky. I slowly eliminated certain "food" products from my diet, ones that I don't believe was needed. I became vegetarian almost 3 years ago, but told myself I could never transition to a wholefoods plant based diet because it means I would have to give up lollies and cakes and cheese. But eventually I cut out refined sugars, and all dairy products, and I'm now where I am today. I have reduced my wheat intake, and if I eat wheat now it is in very small amounts and it is always wholegrain and/or sourdough. I don't eat refined sugars or most processed foods, and I also don't eat anything with preservatives or additives in it. I only drink water or herbal tea's, which was a huge change for me. I make most of my foods from scratch- and I've never felt better. I fit so much into every day of my life, and I feel that the only way I'm able to achieve this is with the food I am putting into my body. I like to nourish my body, and fill it with nutritious foods and lots of water. I am happy, healthy, and I'm also strong.</p>
<p>I don't believe that there is one way of eating that suit everybody, as everybody is different and everybody has different goals. My goal is long term health, which is why I try to put nourishing foods into my body every day. I think it is unhealthy to overthink your diet and become "obsessed" with what you eat. I would like everyone to have a good relationship with food, and not feel bad every time you eat something you are trying to avoid. My favourite take away it Thai food, and although I know that is has many bad ingredients in it, I don't feel bad when I eat it. I don't eat it often, but when I do eat it I really really really enjoy it.</p>
<p>I have been a personal trainer for a few years now, but I still feel that nutrition is far more important than the exercise. I could push you as hard as I want, every day of the week, but if you don't change your diet then you wont reach your goals. I am all about a slow transition, as I don't think that any long lasting changes should happen overnight. I believe in a healthy lifestyle- not a healthy few months until you give up and go back to your old ways. I don't believe in the term "dieting", because I believe in a healthy lifestyle. Eating well, sleeping well, resting well, exercising well, and doing something you love- is what is important.</p>
<p>I hope to change the lives of individuals, and families. Your family's health should be one of the most important things to you. Your health is something you should would want to work on for the rest of your life. I will be sharing recipes, healthy family workout and meal ideas, exercise programs, and little tips to help you along with your transition to better health. I will also be selling my delicious healthy cakes very soon too! Its awesome that we can eat cake that is good for us and delicious at the same time!</p>
<p>Keep an eye out for all I have planned for this year! You don't want to miss any of my announcements. If you have any questions, please contact me via the contact tab, and I will try to get back to you as soon as possible.
My goal is to make the world a healthier place, and I'm starting with a little town on a beautiful beach in Victoria, called Warrnambool.</p>
