title: About Healthy Desires
---
<p>Hi, my name is Raya and I live in Warrnambool, Victoria. A couple of years ago I graduated from Deakin University with a Bachelor of Commerce- but my passion is with nutrition. I have always had a passion for being fitness and health, but I guess I never really understood health to its true extent. I ate veggies with my dinner most days, and always ate fruit everyday, so I figured that I was “healthy.” My daily diet also consisted of lollies, chips, donuts, chocolate, and fatty greasy food. I would be craving something sweet, so I would go for a run, and afterwards eat a slice, I figured that it would just cancel each other out- oh how I was wrong. I have done a lot of nutrition study myself at home, but later this year hope to go back to University to study nutrition, to further deepen my understanding.</p>
<p>I work at a little shop in Warrnambool called Pronto Fine Food Merchants. I see myself as a "people person", and I love working there and meeting new people and sharing my knowledge about healthy food to our customers.</p>
<p>About 4 years ago was my transition to better health started. I decided to start cutting out foods that I ate too much of- and the first two things were chocolate and donuts. It was hard but I just ate lots of lollies instead. Then I decided to cut out chips, but I just ate lots and lots of shapes and other processed foods instead. (so most people may think that this was pointless- but I still think it helped.) I gave up soft drink, but would just drink heaps of fruit juice. (I assumed that fruit juice was good for me so I drank as much of it as I wanted.) I then decided to eat healthy 5 days during the week, and on the weekend I could eat whatever I wanted. This worked out well and I started to feel great- until Saturday came along each week and I would eat heaps and heaps of bad food, and would feel yukky. I became vegetarian almost 3 years ago, but told myself I could never transition to a wholefoods plant based diet because it means I would have to give up lollies and cakes. But eventually I cut out refined sugars, and all dairy products, and I’m now where I am today. I barely ever eat wheat, and stick to a whole foods plant based diet. I don’t eat refined sugars or most processed foods, and I also don’t eat anything with preservatives or additives in it. I only drink water or herbal tea’s, which was a huge change for me. I make most of my foods from scratch- and I’ve never felt better. I fit so much into every day of my life, and I feel that the only way I’m able to achieve this is with the food I am putting into my body. I like to nourish my body, and fill it with nutritious foods and lots of water. I am happy, healthy, and I’m also strong.</p>
<p>I have been a personal trainer for a few years now, I started my course before I started making my healthy transition, and even though Im a personal trainer- I still feel that nutrition is far more important than the exercise. I could push you as hard as I want, every day- but if you don’t clean up your diet- you wont feel any changes or reach your goals. I am all about a slow transition, as I don’t think that any long lasting changes should happen overnight. I believe in a healthy lifestyle- not a healthy few months until you give up and go back to your old ways. I don’t believe in the term “dieting”, because I believe in a healthy lifestyle. Eating well, sleeping well, resting well, exercising well, and doing something you love- is what is important.</p>
<p>I hope to change the lives of individuals, and families- because isn’t your family’s health the most important thing to you? Is your health something you would want to work on for the rest of your life- for the benefit of yourself and your family? If you answered with a yes, then this is the page for you! I will be sharing recipes, healthy family workout and meal ideas, exercise programs, and little tips to help you along with your transition to better health. I will also be selling my delicious healthy cakes and slices very soon too! Its awesome that we can eat cake that is good for us and delicious at the same time!</p>
<p>Keep an eye out for all I have planned for this year! You don’t want to miss any of my announcements.</p>
<p>My goal is to make the world a healthier place, and Im starting with a little town on a beach, called Warrnambool.</p>
