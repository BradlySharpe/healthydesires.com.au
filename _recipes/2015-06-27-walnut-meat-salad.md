Walnut meat recipe from GH4U. Top 2 containers of mixed salad leaves with the mixture (divide the mixture evenly between the two salad bowls), add 1 tin of red kidney beans (divide between two salad bowls) and top with a few spoonfuls of the cashew sour cream from Good Health 4 You in both containers. This is for your Friday and Saturday Lunch. (The walnut meat can be heated up separately and then added to the salad if you wish.) Leave the remaining of the sour cream mixture I the fridge, for the parsnip sushi Friday and Saturday nights.
