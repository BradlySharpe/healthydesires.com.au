Steam a quarter of a capsicum, a couple of pieces of cauliflower, and about 5 bits of broccoli. While this is steaming, finely chop 1 onion, 2 cloves garlic, and add to a frypan with 2 tsp of coconut or olive oil, and fry for a couple of minutes with 2 TBSP cumin and 2 TBSP coriander. 
Add in 3 heaped TBSP natural peanut butter, 2 TBSP shredded coconut, juice of 1 lime, 1 TBSP tamari sauce and 1 cup of water and stir to combine. 
Simmer for about 10 minutes on low heat, then add 1 packet of tempeh (slice it up into cubes).
Serve half of the satay tempeh with the steamed veg for dinner Monday night (leave out half of the broccoli and add it to a plate for your lentil curry dinner Tuesday night), and add the other half to a small container for lunch on Tuesday. In a separate container add a big handful of salad leaves and season with salt and pepper, and sprinkle over some lemon or lime juice. Tuesday for lunch, heat up the container of leftover satay tempeh and add to the salad.
