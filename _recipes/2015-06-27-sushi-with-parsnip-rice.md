(makes about 6 sushi rolls, 3 for each meal, for Friday and Saturday dinner):
Chop up a box of tempeh, into thin strips and marinate in some tamari sauce while making the rest of the ingredients.
Blend up 1 parsnip, 2 TBSP macadamia nuts, 2 TBSP pumpkin seeds, 1 TBSP tamari sauce, and a small splash of apple cider vinegar in your thermie til the mixture resembles “rice”. Mix in the remaining of the cashew sour cream into the rice. 
Cut up some carrot, asparagus, cucumber and capsicum. Fry up the tempeh in a frypan for a couple of minutes.
Add a 6th of the rice mixture to a nori sheet, top with a 6th of the veggies and a 6th of the tempeh. Roll up like youd usually roll up sushi, and sit aside while making the other 6 rolls. (hint: wet the end of the nori rolls when rolling them up to help the rolls to hold shape when they’re made up.) Cut itno small pieces with a bladed knife, being careful not to rip them all apart, sit half of them on one plate for dinner Friday, and one plate for dinner Saturday (glad wrapped in the fridge.) Serve with tamari sauce.
