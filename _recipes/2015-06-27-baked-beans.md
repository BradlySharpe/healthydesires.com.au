Add 1 diced onion to fry pan with 2 tsp coconut or olive oil and fry til golden, add in 2 cups of tinned tomatoes, 1 cup of cherry tomatoes, and simmer for a couple of minutes. Add 300 grams of cannellini beans and 1 tsp of dried oregano and thyme, and a few mushroom cups sliced, and simmer for about 10 minutes. Serve half of this mixture on top of 1 slice of toasted seed bread, with a quarter of an avocado (or if avocados are hard to get- add 1 TBSP of nut butter to bread after toasting it.) for Wednesday breakfast, and leave other half in a bowl for breakfast on Thursday. On Thursday serve the remaining mixture the same way as the day before.
