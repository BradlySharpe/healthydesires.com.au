Microwave a sweet potato that has been picked with a fork for 6 minutes in microwave, or til soft. While its cooking, slice half a box of tempeh, and fry in a frypan with some tamari sauce and minced garlic and ginger for a few minutes. Top sweet potato with a couple of TBSP of hummus, the tempeh and then serve with a big handful of mixed salad leaves.
