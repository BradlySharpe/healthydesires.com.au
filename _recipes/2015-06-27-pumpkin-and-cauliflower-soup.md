Add 1 garlic clove, minced, and 1 diced onion to a fry pan with 2 TBSP olive oil, and fry for a few minutes until golden. Add 2 tsp curry powder, and 3 cups of roughly chopped pumpkin to frypan and cook until curry powder is fragrant. Cover the pumpkin with 2 cups of liquid vegetable stock (preferably massel brand - or make your own in your thermie from your everyday cookbook) and simmer for about 10 minutes until pumpkin is half cooked. Add 1/2 head of cauliflower (cut into florets) and simmer until veggies are soft. Remove the soup form the stove, add to thermie with 2 TBSP natural peanut butter, and blitz until smooth. Divide into two containers for Wednesday dinner and Thursday lunch.
