Add 1 tin of tomatoes to a pot, and add in some garlic and herbs and a pinch of salt, simmer for about 10 minutes and add to a couple of containers for the relish, to top the burgers with. 
Prick 1 sweet potato with a fork a few times and add to a plate in the microwave, microwave for 6 minutes or until soft.  Grate 1 zucchini and 1 carrot, and squeeze the juice out of the slightly. Add to a bowl with 1 diced onion, 1 tsp curry powder, 1 tsp cumin, 1 tsp coriander, 1 minced garlic clove, 1 tin of cooked green lentils and 1/3 cup psyllium husks.  Season with salt and pepper, and add in the sweet potato mashed, once cooked. Mix all together (I find it easier to blend it up slightly in the thermomix. Heat 2 TBSP olive oil in a fry pan, and make the mixture into about 9 patties, fry for a few minutes on each side (or until cooked through.) For Wednesday, serve 3 of these patties with salad leaves topped with lemon juice, and with half of the tomato relish.  For Thursday, serve 3 of these patties with half a cup of cooked quinoa and a few pieces of steamed broccoli, topped with remaining relish.
